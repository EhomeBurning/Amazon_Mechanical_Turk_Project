Depending in which language and in which country you learnt European history, you would use different names to design the Kingdom of Sardinia. The official name was Kingdom of Sardinia (english), Regno di Sardegna (italian), Royaume de Sardaigne (french), K?nigreich Sardinien  (german). Innoficially, but commonly used in Europe are designations such as ""Royaume de Pi?mont-Sardaigne"" (french), ""K?nigreich Sardinien-Piemont"" (german), Or ""Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia"" to emphasise that in the composite state under the rule of Savoy the Island of Sardinia was of secondary importance to the monarchy. The Turin Treaty of 24 March 1860 sanctioned the annexation of the Nice and Savoy counties to France, based on the secret agreement (1858) that if France would support the unification of Italy by Sardinia, in return Sardinia was asked to cede the Duchy of Savoy to France along with, more contentiously, the predominantly non french speaking County of Nice. In 1860 the state of Italy did not exist. Nizza (Nice) never belonged to Italy."

""150 years ago Nice was an Italian city"" is grossly false: When the States of Savoy give Nice to France in 1860, Italy does not even exist (it was founded in 1861)... Nice was also not of ""pre-Italian"" culture, or spirit, at this time: The language spoken in the city was French, not Italian; actually, during the municipal plebiscite of 1860, 86% of voters opted for the attachment to France."
